##

-  Keep track of entity data (3D) while they search for a location.
    -  Currently supporting entities such as:
        - NPCs
        - Vehicles
        - and more - feel free to add your own.

    - Current pathfinding algorithms in use:
        - A*
        - Dijkstra

## Supported Versions

  | Version | Supported          |
  | ------- | ------------------ |
  | > 4.3   | :white_check_mark: |
  | < 4.2   | :x:                |

(See `versions.md` for version history.)




## Compiling

1. Clone the repo.
    - `git clone https://github.com/denv3rr/RouteNodeHandler.git`

2. Navigate to the `src` folder.
    - `cd RouteNodeHandler/src`

3. Compile. The current build can be compiled with 2 options:
    1. Named:
        - `g++ -I ../include *.cpp -o '<out file name>'`
    2. Default:
        - `g++ -I ../include *.cpp` - for an **unnamed** out file.
    
    - These 2 compile options use the "Include" (`-I`) tag to add 2 things:
        1. The `include` folder found one directory back: `../include`
        2. All (`*`) other files ending in `.cpp` (located in the `src` folder).

    - Depending on what you specify at compilation, the compiled out/exe file will then be added to the same folder you are in (should be `src`).

4. Run the `.exe` file.

## Notes

1. Entity Identification: Each entity (NPC or Vehicle) is identified by its type and ID, like "Entity: NPC 1" or "Entity: Vehicle 3". This clarifies which entity is being processed.

2. Start and Goal Nodes: For each entity, the start node and goal node are printed (e.g., "Start Node: 0", "Goal Node: 99"). If the start or goal node is blocked, subnodes are generated and tried.

3. Subnode Attempts: If the start or goal node is blocked, the log shows "Start node blocked, trying subnodes..." and attempts to find subnodes. The subnode IDs are also shown (e.g., "Start Node: 2899 at (0, 0, 3)").

4. Pathfinding: After attempting subnodes, the pathfinding algorithm is initiated ("Initiating pathfinding algorithm..."). If no path is found, the log prints "No path found."

5. Multithreading-like Output: The logs may seem to jump between entities because multiple entities are processed sequentially in each simulation step. This can give the appearance of multithreading but is a result of each entity attempting pathfinding one after the other. This will be added eventually.

6. Goal Reached: At the end, if a path is successfully found, it reconstructs and prints the path ("Goal node reached").
