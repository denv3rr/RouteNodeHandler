##

- Handling of nodes for objects such as:
    - NPCs
    - Vehicles
    - and more.

- Current pathfinding algorithms in use:
    - A*
    - Dijkstra

## Supported Versions

  | Version | Supported          |
  | ------- | ------------------ |
  | > 4.3   | :white_check_mark: |
  | < 4.2   | :x:                |


## Compiling

1. Clone the repo.
    - `git clone https://github.com/denv3rr/RouteNodeHandler.git`

2. Navigate to the `src` folder.
    - `cd RouteNodeHandler/src`

3. Compile. The current build will be compiled with:
    - `g++ -I ../include *.cpp -o '<out file name>'`
    - Or, simply:
    - `g++ -I ../include *.cpp` - for a **default** out file.
    - These 2 compile options use the "Include" - `-I` tag to add the `include` folder found one directory back and all other files ending in `.cpp` (that are located in the `src` folder).
    - Depending on what you specify at compilation, the compiled out/exe file will then be added to the same folder you are in (should be `src`).

4. Run the `.exe` file.

## Notes

1. Entity Identification: Each entity (NPC or Vehicle) is identified by its type and ID, like "Entity: NPC 1" or "Entity: Vehicle 3". This clarifies which entity is being processed.

2. Start and Goal Nodes: For each entity, the start node and goal node are printed (e.g., "Start Node: 0", "Goal Node: 99"). If the start or goal node is blocked, subnodes are generated and tried.

3. Subnode Attempts: If the start or goal node is blocked, the log shows "Start node blocked, trying subnodes..." and attempts to find subnodes. The subnode IDs are also shown (e.g., "Start Node: 2899 at (0, 0, 3)").

4. Pathfinding: After attempting subnodes, the pathfinding algorithm is initiated ("Initiating pathfinding algorithm..."). If no path is found, the log prints "No path found."

5. Multithreading-like Output: The logs may seem to jump between entities because multiple entities are processed sequentially in each simulation step. This can give the appearance of multithreading but is a result of each entity attempting pathfinding one after the other. This will be added eventually.

6. Goal Reached: At the end, if a path is successfully found, it reconstructs and prints the path ("Goal node reached").




## Version History

- **Version 4.3.0:**
    - **Updates:**
        - Dynamic Subnode Grid System:
            - Implemented subnode grids that load dynamically when the main node is blocked.
            - Introduced lazy-loading subnodes between nodes, improving scalability during complex pathfinding scenarios.
        - Improved Output Format:
            - Enhanced output to display subnode creation and usage during blocked node situations, providing clearer traceability of subnodes.
        - Bug Fixes & Optimizations:
            - Refined logic for switching between nodes and subnodes during pathfinding, reducing unnecessary computations.

- **Version 4.2.0:**
    - **Updates:**
        - Implemented Additional Pathfinding Algorithm:
            - Introduced the DijkstraPathfinder class to provide an alternative pathfinding method alongside A*.
        - Dynamic Algorithm Selection:
            - Enabled runtime switching between A* and Dijkstra algorithms based on user input or simulation conditions.
        - Optimized Pathfinding Performance:
            - Replaced std::endl with \n in output statements to enhance compilation and execution speed.
            - Reduced overall execution time by optimizing node blocking and path recalculation logic.
        - Enhanced Node Blocking Mechanism:
            - Improved the logic for randomly blocking and unblocking nodes during simulation to reflect dynamic environments better.
        - Error Handling Enhancements:
            - Added checks to ensure the pathfinding algorithm is set before attempting to find paths, preventing runtime errors.
            - Implemented the hasAlgorithm method in PathfindingManager for safer algorithm usage.
        - Color-Coded Output for Improved Readability:
            - Enhanced console outputs with ANSI color codes to differentiate between information, warnings, and errors.
            - Ensured that node status updates (blocked/unblocked) and pathfinding results were clearly color-coded for better traceability.
        - Bug Fixes:
            - Resolved issues related to undefined functions and missing includes, ensuring smoother compilation and runtime stability.

    - **(Working On):**

            - Refactor existing code to support future expansions and facilitate easier testing.
            - Structure classes and methods to promote modularity (to make the codebase more maintainable).
        - Advanced Traffic Rules Implementation:
            - Introduce more sophisticated traffic rules, including stoplights, speed limits, and intersection management, to increase simulation realism.
        - Entity Behavior Models:
            - Implement diverse behaviors for entities (NPCs and vehicles), such as aggressive, cautious, or normal driving styles, to enrich the simulation dynamics.
        - Additional Pathfinding Algorithms:
            - Expand the pathfinding toolkit by adding more algorithms like Best-First Search or Bidirectional Search for comparative analysis and enhanced flexibility.

- **Version 4.1.0:**
    - **Updates:**
        - Modularized pathfinding logic by introducing the AStarPathfinder class.
        - Added detailed debugging statements with color-coded outputs for better traceability.
